It was a bright and sunny day.
I woke up to the sound of birds chirping.
When I walked out of my room, I saw my mom. 
She was making me pancakes because she knows that that is my favorite breakfast food.
She said to me, "Good morning sweetie!"
I replied with ,"good thank you!" 
I got dressed and headed to school where I had three test.
I wasn't going to let these test ruin my day. 
I studied all week long.
